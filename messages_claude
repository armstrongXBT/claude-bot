# Claude-inspired messages: calm, helpful, safety-first tech tone.
MESSAGES = [
    "Design for clarity: make APIs explicit about intent and failure modes.",
    "When in doubt, opt for safe defaults that protect users quietly.",
    "Small, consistent improvements to reliability compound into trust.",
    "Explain trade-offs plainly — engineers and users both benefit.",
    "Build observability before you need it; it shortens incident time-to-resolution.",
    "Make onboarding incremental: let users do one useful thing fast.",
    "Prioritize recovery paths — graceful degradation keeps people productive.",
    "Invest in developer ergonomics: good docs and examples matter.",
    "Measure impact in helpful outcomes, not vanity signals.",
    "Keep interfaces predictable; surprises are costly at scale.",
    "Automate routine safety checks to reduce human error.",
    "Design for the user’s mental model, and test that assumption early.",
    "Minimal surfaces reduce attack vectors and support load.",
    "Document assumptions and post-mortems so teams learn faster.",
    "Design for interoperability — integration friction kills adoption.",
    "Provide clear error messages that guide recovery, not blame.",
    "Secure defaults plus optional power-user choices is a good balance.",
    "Make data flows auditable so trust can be evaluated objectively.",
    "Keep latency predictable; performance surprises reduce confidence.",
    "Prefer explicit permissions and transparency over opaque automation.",
    "Ship small experiments, learn quickly, and iterate with humility.",
    "Surface the cost of actions to users so they can make informed choices.",
    "Reduce surprise notifications — only alert when action is needed.",
    "Choose simplicity when it meaningfully improves reliability.",
    "Design UX that helps users recover from common mistakes.",
    "Communicate changes early and clearly to reduce user confusion.",
    "Automated tests and staged rollouts reduce production risk.",
    "Encourage graceful defaults that protect new users by design.",
    "Observe real-world usage to validate product hypotheses.",
    "Make it easy to report issues and see their resolution status.",
