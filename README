# Claude‑inspired Scheduled Tweet Bot

This repository contains a simple scheduled Twitter/X bot that posts short, calm, helpful, tech-focused messages inspired by a safety-first assistant voice.

Important: Tweets are "inspired-by" the assistant voice. Do NOT impersonate Claude or Anthropic. Include a visible disclosure in your account bio and in tweets (the bot prepends a short disclosure by default).

Quickstart
1. Create a Twitter/X developer app and obtain API credentials.
2. Create a `.env` from `.env.example` and fill in credentials.
3. Install dependencies:
   - python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run locally:
   - python bot.py
5. (Optional) Build and run with Docker:
   - docker build -t claude-bot .
   - docker run --env-file .env claude-bot

Configuration
- POST_INTERVAL_MINUTES: scheduling frequency (default 60)
- DISCLOSURE: short prefix added to each tweet (default: "(inspired-by Claude) ")

Notes
- Test on a throwaway account before posting from a main account.
- Store secrets in environment variables or a secrets manager — never commit them.
- Respect platform automation rules and rate limits.
